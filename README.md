# Elixir-User-Agent

## Introduction
- Developed a web server that tells the user what their user-agent is.
- Utilized sockets (`:gen_tcp`) for providing the socket server functionality.

## Installation and Execution
 - Run ```iex server.exs``` to start the local server.
 - Visit http://localhost:3000 on any browser to check your user agent. 
 - ```Your User-Agent is: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0```
